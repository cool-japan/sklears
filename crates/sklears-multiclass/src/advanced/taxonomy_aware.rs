//! Taxonomy-aware classification
//!
//! This module provides classification strategies that leverage taxonomies and ontologies.

// This is a placeholder file - the taxonomy-aware functionality is included in hierarchical.rs
// for now. In the future, this could be split out into its own module.

pub use super::hierarchical::{
    Taxonomy, TaxonomyAwareClassifier, TaxonomyBuilder, TaxonomyConfig, TaxonomyNode,
