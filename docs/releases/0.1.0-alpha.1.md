# sklears 0.1.0-alpha.1 Release Notes

**Release date:** October 13, 2025  \
**Commit baseline:** `main` @ 0.1.0-alpha.1  \
**Workspace tests:** 10,013 passed · 69 skipped · 0 failed

## Overview

The first public alpha for sklears delivers a near-complete, Rust-native port of the scikit-learn experience. This drop consolidates six months of rapid development across more than 50 crates, bringing >99% API coverage, aggressive performance tuning, and end-to-end documentation into a cohesive release.

## Highlights

- **Massive API Coverage** – Practically the entire scikit-learn estimator and transformer surface is implemented, including advanced modules (gaussian_process, semi_supervised, feature_extraction, multioutput, compose, inspection).
- **Performance Everywhere** – SIMD, Rayon, cache-friendly data layouts, and GPU backends (CUDA/WebGPU) deliver 3–100× wins over CPython baselines in the supplied benchmarks.
- **AutoML + Pipelines** – Comprehensive model selection stack (Grid/Random/Halving searches, cross-validators), type-safe pipelines, permutation importance, and display utilities ready for production.
- **Data Interop** – Polars DataFrame adapters, CSV/Parquet loaders, dataset generators, and memory-mapped dataset support streamline large workflows.
- **Python Bridge** – `sklears-python` PyO3 bindings mirror the Rust APIs, enabling drop-in experimentation from existing Python pipelines.

## Compatibility Notes

- Rust 1.70+ is required across the workspace. Nightly is optional but not necessary.
- The SciRS2 dependency stack is locked to `0.1.0-rc.1` crates. Verify GPU feature flags against your platform before enabling CUDA.
- Expect minor breaking changes before `0.1.0-beta`; public APIs will be frozen after the beta milestone lands.

## Upgrade Guide

1. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   sklears = "0.1.0-alpha.1"
   ```
2. Enable the feature sets you need (e.g., `linear`, `clustering`, `parallel`, `python` for bindings).
3. Consult the refreshed [README](../../README.md) for module-specific quickstarts and benchmarking instructions.
4. Python users can install the preview wheel via `maturin develop --release` inside `crates/sklears-python`.

## Testing & Quality Gates

- `cargo nextest` workspace: 10,013 tests passing (69 skipped).
- Integration suites under `tests/` exercise cross-crate behavior (pipelines, GPU offload, dataset loaders).
- Criterion benchmarks in `benches/` validated performance regressions against the June 2025 baselines.
- Clippy and rustfmt enforced in CI; no outstanding warnings at release tag aside from long-term tracking items documented in crate-level TODOs.

## What's Next

- Stabilize the public API surface for `0.1.0-beta` and introduce a formal RFC process for new estimator traits.
- Expand the cookbook and migration guides, with emphasis on GPU workflows and large-scale deployment.
- Automate release pipelines to crates.io and PyPI, including signature verification and changelog generation.
- Broaden ecosystem adoption with sample apps (web inference, streaming pipelines) and community outreach.

## Thanks

Huge shout-out to everyone who contributed tests, documentation, and feedback during the alpha cycle. Please file issues or start a discussion with any early findings so we can polish the beta together.
